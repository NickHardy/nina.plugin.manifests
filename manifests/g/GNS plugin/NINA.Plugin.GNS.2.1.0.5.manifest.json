        "LongDescription": "N.I.N.A. - Nighttime Imaging 'N' Astronomy GNS Plugin\r\n\r\nThe good night system by LunaticoAstro is a monitoring system that let's you sleep at night.\r\n\r\nhttps://lunaticoastro.com/gns-observatory-monitoring/\r\n\r\n! These instructions will not pause the sequencer. Timeouts are only for the GNS server. When a timeout is reached GNS will trigger an alarm.\r\n\r\nTriggers:\r\nGNS trigger - This will trigger for every instruction within the instruction set and send a message based on the estimated runtime of the instruction plus 5 minutes.\r\nGNS MeridianFlip trigger - This basically calls the MeridianFlip trigger within Nina and does the same. Timeout is based on the estimated runtime for the flip plus 15 minutes.\r\n\r\nInstructions:\r\nGNS Message - Send a message to the GNS server. Enter your own message and timeout in seconds.\r\nGNS Pause session - Pause the GNS session. (For instance if you run a script and don't know how long it could take)\r\nGNS Alert session - Send a session Alert. The GNS server will send an alert to your phone. You can enter your own message. Usually followed by an alert box in Nina or a script.\r\nGNS End session - End the current GNS session.\r\n\r\nPlease report any issues in the [Nina discord server](https://discord.gg/rWRbVbw) and tag me: @NickHolland#5257 \r\n\r\nIf you would like to buy me a whisky: [click here](https://www.paypal.com/paypalme/NickHardyHolland)\r\n",
